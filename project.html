                <h1>During my studies for a diploma in New Media Communication and Content Entrepreneurship, my group and I were assigned a project in the game development subject to create a 2D pixelated game using Unreal Engine 5. My group, Dimensional Studio, decided to develop the "Gold Hunter" game. The concept for "Gold Hunter" was inspired by the classic mobile game Temple Run. We aimed to infuse it with a nostalgic pixel art style while incorporating a top-down perspective to enhance the gameplay experience. With the guidance of our game development lecturer, it took us a year to complete the game. My role within the team was to create blueprints for all game functions. This involved designing the core mechanics, collision detection, and item collection. Additionally, I was tasked with troubleshooting and resolving any errors or issues that arose during gameplay testing. </h1>
                <h2>Every year, my course will hold a game exhibition event called "GameINC". The purpose of this event is to showcase all self-made games from semester 4 students. This event was held at UiTM Lendu, Alor Gajah, Melaka from 11 until 13 July 2024. The event attracted numerous visitors, both from inside and outside of UiTM, who served as beta testers for the 10 games featured. Among the games showcased, our game, "Gold Hunter" stood out and earned the Best Game award in 2024.</h2>
                <h3>Throughout this assignment, developing "Gold Hunter" significantly enhanced my proficiency with Unreal Engine 5, particularly in creating and managing game blueprints.  Addressing and resolving gameplay issues honed my problem-solving skills, allowing me to think critically and creatively under pressure. Working within a team taught me valuable project management skills, including time management, task delegation, and effective communication.</h3>
                <h4>The development of "Gold Hunter" was a transformative experience in my journey as a game designer. The project not only allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting but also equipped me with essential skills for my future career. The recognition and success at the GameINC exhibition underscored the impact of our efforts and inspired me to continue pursuing excellence in game development.</h4>
